# Increment-and-Decrement-Timer_Matlab-Simulink
In this study, I made an increasing and decreasing timer on Simulink.
Model Settings;
  Solver;
    Simulation time -> Start time: 0.0 - Stop time: 20
    Solver selection -> Type: Fixed-step - Solver: discrete (no continuous states)
    Solver details -> Fixed-step size (fundamental sample time): 0.1
